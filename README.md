Hi, it turns out I'm also using this repository as a little self-introduction because these are the fun things I've done  with my techincal skills whatever you call it although I doubt if anyone will see it and the intro itself is mostly copy-pasted from LinkedIn:

This is Kelly from a CS background and have genuine interest in observing human behavior and extracting insights from data. I still use last.fm Scrobblr and am a recurrent visitor to r\dataisbeautiful. Currently a second year master student in Information Science at Cornell Tech, aiming to become a human-centered scientist.

I'm actively looking for a full time position in data analyst/data science field. I would love to use data manipulation skills and ML/DL knowledge to find fun or mind-blowing facts, aesthetically visualize them, offer business insights and make interesting products. 

I'm a huge media consumer in my spare time. I constantly dig for critically acclaimed old films; I'm a heavy listener of heavy metal (even attended a course about it!) and I like progressive stuff; also a comedy lover. That is why I've got all these projects, because I enjoy peeking *INTO* the data and letting the truth emerge!
