    "This is a fan base analysis for the British rock band Muse! I'm a fan since 2012 and have been streaming them 7/24 in this winter vacation. I've always been curious about what people like of Muse, and when I saw the poll I though I'd do something fun with the data. The original data is from [this poll](https://www.reddit.com/r/Muse/comments/aepifo/results_for_muse_poll_here/) from **r/Muse**. Shout out for **u/trickfinger96** for letting me use the data!"

    "Some conclusions here:\n",
    "- From the first row: generally people love OOS, Absolution and BH&R.\n",
    "- From the second row: looks like Muse got their fame or major fan base growth around BH&R, because most people's first Muse song is from there and it's also the first album listened to in its integrity. (I guess the song would be Supermassive Blackhole!)\n",
    "- From the third row, we can see a surge in the number of fans at around 2009 and 2015. Umm, 2009 was the release of The Resistance, which is a critical album too. Here's a little anecdote: [China banned them because of Uprising from this album](https://kroq.radio.com/blogs/kevin-bean-show/muse-uprising-china) (btw I'm from China). 2015 was the release of Drones.\n",
    "- From the fourth row, we see the distribution of 3-tier fans. They are really becoming famous..."

    "I myself am a fan since 2012, so I belong to the second tier. The first song I've listened to is Madness from The 2nd Law, but the album turns out to be my least favorite one. My favorite album is Original of Symmetry, it involves a bit of conspiracy theory too, and the same concept of the [album art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_of_Symmetry) is used in the latest Black Mirror interactive episode [Bandersnatch](https://www.netflix.com/title/80988062). As I love their older stuff, I want to check if my taste aligns better with the early fans."
